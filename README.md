#### you can always count on me if you need help, to chat and to have a drink.

###### I had a chance encounter with a pastor who told me about a wonderful event held at his church. “We had a singing group the other day that performed without instruments,” he said. “A cappella?” I asked. He shrugged. “I don’t remember the name of the group.

*When I was a teenager, I went to school on crutches and with my left foot in a cast. I had to go up a step and I sprained my leg again, so I ended up in a wheelchair with both feet in a cast.*

*Never rush while on crutches.*
